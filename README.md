# ZMK Firmware and Keyboard Layout

## Firmware

This repository contains the board definitions for the [nightliner](https://github.com/michaelrommel/nightliner) mechanical, split keyboard. Since these are two boards with an MCU directly on the PCB, there are no shield definitions, just two boards. They live under the config/boards/arm/nightliner path.

The firmware can be built locally, if all of ZMK's and Zephyr's toolchain are installed using the command lines:

```
west build -p -d build/left -b nightliner_left -- -DZMK_CONFIG="${HOME}/Software/keyboard/zmk-config/config"
west build -p -d build/right -b nightliner_right -- -DZMK_CONFIG="${HOME}/Software/keyboard/zmk-config/config"
```

But also as designed by the good people from the ZMK project, a github workflow is triggered on every push that changes the firmware relevant files.


## Keymap

The board directory also contains my default keymap definition. The graphical representation below is directly generated from the keymap file using (Cem Aksoylar's)[https://github.com/caksoylar] excellent (keymap-drawer)[https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer] tool.

The images are also autogenerated using github workflows.
